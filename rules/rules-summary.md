# Rules Summary

### Rolling the DiceWhen you try to overcome an obstacle, you roll dice. Start with one die. Add a die if you have a trait that can help you. If that trait has any tags that apply, add another die for each tag. Finally, add any number of dice from your personal pool of dice (your pool starts with 7 dice).Roll all the dice you’ve gathered. Each die that shows 4 or higher is a hit. You need hits equal to the difficulty level (usually 3) to pass the obstacle.Levels: 2 easy — 3 difficult — 4 challenging — 5 extremeIf you pass, discard all the dice you rolled (including any pool dice you used). Don’t worry, you can get your pool dice back.If you don’t pass, you don’t yet achieve your goal. But, you get to keep the pool dice you rolled and add another die to your pool. The GM will escalate the situation in some way and you might be able to try again.
### Conditions
When events warrant or especially when you fail a roll, the GM may impose a condition on your character: Injured, Dead, Tired, Angry, Lost, Hunted, or Trapped. When you take a condition, mark its box and say how it comes about. [Note: The “dead” condition just means “presumed dead” unless you say otherwise.]### HelpingIf your character is in a position to help another character, you can give them a die from your pool. Say what your character does to help. If the roll fails, you get your pool die back. If it succeeds, your die is lost.
### Keys
When you hit a Key, you can do one of two things:
- Take an experience point (XP)- Add a die to your pool (up to a max of 10)
If you go into danger because of your key, you get 2 XP or 2 pool dice (or 1 XP and 1 pool die). When you have accumulated 5 XP, you earn an advance. You can spend an advance on one of the following:
- Add a new Trait (based on something you learned during play or on some past experience that has come to light)- Add a tag to an existing trait- Add a new Key (you can never have the same key twice) 
- Learn a Secret (if you have the means to)

You can hold on to advances if you want, and spend them at any time, even in the middle of a battle!

Each key also has a buyoff. If the buyoff condition occurs, you have the option of removing the Key and earning two advances.

### Refresh

You can refresh your pool back to 7 dice by having a refreshment scene with another character. You may also remove a condition or regain the use of a Secret, depending on the details of the scene. A refreshment scene is a good time to ask questions (in character) so the other player can show off aspects of his or her PC — “Why did you choose this life?” — “What do you think of the Lady?” — “Why did you take this job?” etc. Refreshment scenes can be flashbacks, too.

## Running the Game
### Tips, tricks, and advice for the GM

### Listen & Ask Questions, Don’t Plan

When you’re the GM, don’t try to plan what will happen. Instead, ask questions—lots and lots and make them pointed toward the things you’re interested in. Like, Cyrus gives Naomi an order within earshot of Lady Blackbird, but the Lady’s player doesn’t register it right away. Naomi goes to follow the order. So I ask Lady Blackbird’s player, “How do you react when the Captain orders your bodyguard around? Is that okay with you?” And then, when it’s totally not okay,“What do you say to him? What do you say to Naomi?” and a few more like that and everyone is yelling at each other and rolling dice to impose their will.Also ask questions like:- “Does anything break when you do this crazy maneuver?”- “The fire probably spreads out of control doesn’t it?”- “That sounds like a bold plan. What’s the first step?”- “Do the two of you end up somewhere quiet together? Does something happen between you?”- “Do you know anything about the Crimson Sky rebels? What are they like? Is it normal for them to be this far into the Empire?”Keep that going at a steady pace and the game flies along pretty well. Part of the job of the GM is listening to what the players say, catching it, turning it around and looking at it, and seeing if there’s anything else to be done with it.
The GM’s jobs: listen and reincorporate, play the NPCs with gusto, create interesting obstacles, and impose conditions as events warrant (especially when rolls fail).
### Say Yes, Look For the Obstacles
By default, characters can accomplish anything covered by their traits. They’re competent and effective people, in other words. It’s no fun to ask for a roll when there’s no cool obstacle in the way. Just say yes to the action, listen, and ask questions as usual. But also, be on the look out for the opportunity to create obstacles as the action develops. Because you’re asking leading questions and listening closely, they’ll be all over the place, so it won’t be too hard to spot them. 
Obstacles can be people (pirates, goblins, imperials, citizens, nobles), weather, monsters (sky squid, flying eels), situations (fires, falling, being shot at, chases, escapes) or anything else you can imagine.
If a character tries something not covered by their traits, that’s an obstacle right there: lack of experience and training. Lots of fun things can go wrong when you don’t know what you’re doing! Also, players will sometimes try things they’re bad at so they can fail and add dice to their pool. It’s a fine move for them and it gives you the chance to create more trouble, so everyone wins.
### ConditionsA condition constrains what the player should say about their character. It’s a cue to tell the GM and players to pay attention to that thing and use it as material for the developing fiction. Gaming is just us saying stuff to each other, right? So you’re like, “What do I say now?” and you look down and go, “Oh, I’m angry. I’ll go be angry at someone then. ‘Snargle! Why aren’t we at Nightport yet, you shiftless layabout?!’” For the GM, the conditions can create opportunities or give permissions. “You’re Injured, right? The Void Spiders can smell blood. They swarm right at you, ignoring the others.” Sometimes a condition will become an Obstacle in its own right, calling for a roll to deal with it.
